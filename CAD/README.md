# WP-DAKSH 3D Printed Tool Changer - CAD Models

CAD Models are being provided due to the excellent effort of @edcasati who took it upon to convert the STLs from Tinkercad into a viable Fusion 360 Model. It might not be perfect - but its an excellent start for anyone who wants to modify the WP-DAKSH tool changer to fit their system.

Many Thanks @edcasati - really appreciate the effort.
